# Instructions

Include here a short paragraph (less than 70 words) explaining what you
learned of the two chosen methods. The purpose is just to reflect on what
you did.



The first method that i used was linear regression, my variable that I wanted 

to impute my data, meaning the one i was interested because missed data, 

was ingtot. The linear regression has awful results, most likely because

the model is poorly identified, and it could only return about 20 of the 480 

missing data. And it transform the distribution a lot and put negative ingresos. 

The second one was linear interpolation, which had a better performance

than the linear regression, it did not change abruptly the distribution. 

However, little I know what was the second variable that was using to 

interpolate, since it needs to variables to interpolate and usually is 

a time variable. So, in the future, maybe a regression, or KNN would perform

better.
